          <h3>Why Care?</h3>
          <p>"Microplastics are ubiquitous across ecosystems, yet the exposure risk to humans is unresolved. Focusing on
            the American diet, we evaluated the number of microplastic particles in commonly consumed foods in relation
            to their recommended daily intake. The potential for microplastic inhalation and how the source of drinking
            water may affect microplastic consumption were also explored. Our analysis used 402 data points from 26
            studies, which represents over 3600 processed samples. Evaluating approximately 15% of Americans’ caloric
            intake, we estimate that annual microplastics consumption ranges from 39000 to 52000 particles depending on
            age and sex. These estimates increase to 74000 and 121000 when inhalation is considered. Additionally,
            individuals who meet their recommended water intake through only bottled sources may be ingesting an
            additional 90000 microplastics annually, compared to 4000 microplastics for those who consume only tap
            water. These estimates are subject to large amounts of variation; however, given methodological and data
            limitations, these values are likely underestimates."<br /> <a

          <p>Just reading those words makes me want to swap everything I eat and drink to organicly produced. The
            American Food system has been contaminated by coorporate greed, and I plan to create a homestead for my
            family where I can raise my own livestock and grown my own food. To do this, I've researched into a few
            different ways of growing food, and a lot of what I came back with was wasteful on something, be that water,
            area, or even ground quality in the long term. Permaculter seems to be the perfect answer to every problem
            that we face in our current style of farming.</p>
          <h3>Why Does Permaculture Work?</h3>
          <p>"The philosophy behind permaculture is one of working with, rather than against, nature; of protracted and
            thoughtful observation rather than protracted and thoughtless action; of looking at systems in all their
            functions, rather than asking only one yield of them; and allowing systems to demonstrate their own
            evolutions."</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"The conscious design and maintenance of agriculturally productive ecosystems which have the diversity,
              stability, and resilience of natural ecosystems.""</li>
            <li>"It is the harmonious integration of landscape and people — providing their food, energy, shelter, and
              other material and non-material needs in a sustainable way.""</li>
            <li>"It is a multidisciplinary toolbox including agriculture, water harvesting and hydrology, energy,
              natural
              building, forestry, waste management, animal systems, aquaculture, appropriate technology, economics and
              community development."</li>
